Explain Primary data types and complex data types in Hive with an example in brief ?

PRIMARY DATA TYPES:
 Primary Data Types are classified into four categories. They are: 
  • Numeric Types 
  • String Types 
  • Date/Time Types 
  • Miscellaneous Types
  
     Numerical Data types are mainly divided into 2 types:
       Integral Data Types
       Floating Data Types
       
Integral Data Types: 
   TINYINT (This TINYINT is equal to Java’s BYTE data type)
   SMALLINT (This SMALLINT is equal to Java’s SHORT data type)
   INT (This INT is equal to Java’s INT data type)
   BIGINT (This BIGINTis equal to Java’s LONG data type)
   
Floating Data Types:
   FLOAT (This FLOAT is equal to Java’s FLOAT data type )
   DOUBLE (This DOUBLE is equal to Java’s DOUBLE data type)
   DECIMAL (This DECIMAL is equal to SQL’s DECIMAL data type)
   
      String Data Types
        In Hive String Data Types are Mainly divided into 3 types there are mentioned below
           STRING-String literals can be expressed with either single quotes (') or double quotes (") 
           VARCHAR-Varchar types are created with a length specifier (between 1 and 65355), which defines the maximum number of characters allowed in the character string
           CHAR-Char types are similar to Varchar but they are fixed-length meaning that values shorter than the specified length value are padded with spaces but trailing spaces are not important during comparisons.
      Date/Time Types:
         •	Hive provides DATE and TIMESTAMP data types in traditional UNIX time stamp format for date/time related fields in hive.
         •	DATE values are represented in the form YYYY-MM-DD. 
         •	We can also cast the String, Time-stamp values to Date format if they match format.
         •	For Example: DATE ‘2014-12-07’. Date ranges allowed are 0000-01-01 to 9999-12-31.
        
      Miscellaneous Types
          Hive Supports 2 more primitive Data types
            BOOLEAN
            BINARY
        Hive BOOLEAN is similar to Java’s BOOLEAN types,it can stores true or false values only
        BINARY is an array of Bytes and similar to VARBINARY in many RDBMSs. BINARY columns are stored within the record, not separately like BLOBs  


Complex Data types in Hive:

     Complex Types can be built up from primitive types and other composite types.  Data type of the fields in the collection are specified using an angled bracket notation. Currently Hive supports four complex data types. They are:
     •	Array
     •	Map
     •	Struct
     •	UnionType

    ARRAY:
        •	An Ordered sequences of similar type elements that are indexable using
          zero-based integers.
        •	It is similar to arrays in Java. 
        •	For Example – array (‘siva’, ‘bala’, ‘praveen’); First element is accessed with array[0];

    MAP:
        •	Collection of key-value pairs.
        • Fields are accessed using array notation of keys (e.g., [‘key’]).
        •	For Example:’one’->’aju’,’two’->’roll’ is represented as map(‘one’,’aju’,’two’,’roll’).here ‘aju’ can be accessed with map[‘one’].

   STRUCT: 
        •	It is similar to STRUCT in C language.
        •	It is a record type which encapsulates a set of named fields that can be any primitive data type. 
        •	Elements in STRUCT type are accessed using the DOT (.) notation.
        •	For Example – For a column c of type STRUCT {a INT; b INT} the a field is accessed by the expression c.a.

 UNIONTYPE:
        •	It is similar to Unions in C.
        •	At any point of time, an Union Type can hold any one (exactly one) data type from its specified data types.
        •	For Example: UNIONTYPE<int, double, array<string>, struct<a:int,b:string>>.
